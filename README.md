# ThunderEgg

Visit the unicorn in the fertile lands where ETH catalyses with the ancient lava to mine magical LP stones.

Journey to the sacred groves of Thor where sacrificing LP stones will spawn you a mystical ThunderEgg!

The quest can only be attempted once! So pick your runes carefully. Over time, if left to mature the ThunderEgg will increase it's mighty lava energy hour by hour. As the eggs grow old, and the lava grows within, the more enchanting and beautiful they become... 

Be warned! The only way to reap the power of the ThunderEgg is to smite it with a mighty blow.

### What exactly is a ThunderEgg?

ThunderEgg is a mashup of SushiSwap x ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens x Charged Particles x P5 Generative art scripts x Compound "governance". 

Respect to all the giants who came before on who's shoulders we build ThunderEgg!

ThunderEggs are NFTs. LAVA is an ERC20 governance token.

Steps to ThunderEgg enlightment:
* Add liquidity to the ETH <> LAVA pair in Uniswap
* Approve UniV2 tokens to "Sacred Grove" aka SushiSwap pool within the ThunderEgg smart contract
* Contract spawns (aka mints) a ECR721 NFT with a name. One account per NFT max.
* UniV2 tokens locked in the ThunderEgg (until destroyed)
* Farmed $LAVA locked in the ThunderEgg (until destroyed)
* Over time (blocks) the ThunderEgg changes in appearance and internal yield of LAVA increases relative to the staking LP stones (aka UniV2 ERC20 tokens)
* You may choose to destroy the ThunderEgg. This is the only way to receive your LAVA and LP Stones but beware the egg is now gone forever.

Notes from God:
* Thor can destroy the Sacred Grove at any point stopping the fertile production of ThunderEgg's LAVA yield.
* Thor will pre-mine some $LAVA to kickstart the uniswap pair and airdrop LAVA and UniV2 tokens as he sees fit.

## Gamification

As LAVA is locked inside ThunderEggs you have a tricky decision to cash in the egg if and when the price of LAVA in Uniswap rockets?

Or have strong hands as the NFT matures (with tokens and artistic value) that may eclipse the internal value... 

Destroying ThunderEggs reduces supply, theorectially, making the other ThunderEggs worth more (as there is a limited supply). 

NFTs can naturally be sold on the secondary market (via OpenSea and other 3rd party marketplaces) but the internal value transfers with the ThunderEgg

DeFi + NFTs + Generative CryptoArt + Governance = ThunderEggs

### Smart Contracts

The ThunderEgg smaart contract is the 0x team's ERC721 token standard mixed with SushiSwap's master chef contract with extra bespoke logic.

The Lava governance token is a clone of Compounds governance token and therefore can be used with a applicable DAO.

We have full suite of test coverage that can be ran via Buidler: `npx buidler test`
